      - or at least not till after 2012 

Tea-Party Patriots Cofounder
  - left had an advantage in the past election
  - in tea party movement, there are more older people who are participating in technology, some people are buying computers just to keep up with Tea Party Groups
  - text message and mobile applications will be huge
  - not as many people use smart phones now
  - allowed us to nationalized some many races (elections)

Kristian Lockheart

  - Gets people who aren't in your state more interested

My thoughts on first breakout session:
  - Heavy usage of twitter and buzz words



Breakout session 2 -Harvard Institute of Politics
  -"Civility and Social Media: An Oxymoron?"

Discussion
  - Trey Grayson - head of the Institute of Politics at Harvard
  - Tons of civil discourse in the US; does it really matter?
  - @jfkjunior - live tweet

Mindy Finn - worked for Mitt Romney and a few others
  - Why is this one of your favorite topics?
  - Colleges assume yes most of the time
  - the way they approach the internet, people took a cower and fear approach
  - Is man kind civil?
  - People get really excited with new opportunities to get the gotcha moments and hot shots of candidates
  - Right in the midst of social media beginnings
  - Look at the video "Attack ads of the 1800s"

Adam Sharp
Manager, Government and Political Partnerships for Twitter
  - There was discourse before social media
  - thinks back to 1980s debates
  - democratization of discourse
  - probably better visualization of more voices
  - Overall twitter population is interested in correct conversations
  - Efficiency in social media platforms as it has removed pages of information clouding the main view

Eli Paris
  - Guy who wrote The Filter Bubble
  - Always thought that people misperceive twitter and only see the negatives
  - hard wire to pay more attention to negative stuff
  - depends on how the particular medium is designed
  - Twitter shows all
  - same spiel as the book on friending conservatives on facebook
  - show people more data that they are involved with
  - Twitter has much more of a public feeling 
  - People interact differently if they are known or anonymous
 

John DellaVolpe
  - Social Sphere
  - Wrote essay on Wienergate
  - expert on the millennial generation
  - Americans want to be civil (at least from the millennial generation)
  - Lessen the barriers for people to work together
  - Government should identify the best people a lot more
    - and give them more power
    - ask them for help
  - Government should take more lessons from everyone


Mindy Finn
  - Elected officials should personally reply back when using twitter or other social media as it builds a positive relationship

- Adam Sharp
  - Congress is split between Personally replying, don't know about the twitters, or those with some direct involvement
  - Politics has been good with broadcast politics lately, but now that people are so used to that personalized experience 
  - Harder to be uncivil when you have a personalized connection

John
  - There is a bit of an echo chamber
  - Social media is the antidote to broadcast media civil discourse

Eli
  - Is social media making us too civil?
  - somewhat leads towards group think
